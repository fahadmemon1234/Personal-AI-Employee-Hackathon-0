## Message Content:

You write what you want in a specification using markdown. Your spec describes:



What problem you're solving

What the software should do

How to know if it's working

Your responsibility: Make your intent clear.



Why markdown stays in Layer 1: The specification represents your intent — the authoritative definition of what should be built. Even when AI helps draft or refine the spec, you have final approval authority. The implementation (Layer 3) must match the specification, not the other way around. This keeps you in control: change the spec, and the AI rebuilds to match.
